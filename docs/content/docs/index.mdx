# Introduction

**haukTUI** is a component registry for Terminal User Interfaces. Like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for the web,
haukTUI provides beautifully designed, accessible, keyboard-navigable components that you copy directly into your project.

```bash
npx @hauktui/cli add button dialog toast
```

<Callout title="Not a package dependency">
  Components are copied into your project as source files. You own the code -
  customize, extend, and modify as needed. No runtime dependencies, no version
  conflicts.
</Callout>

## Why haukTUI?

Building terminal applications with good UX is hard. You need to handle:

- **Keyboard navigation** - Tab, arrows, vim bindings, shortcuts
- **Focus management** - Which element is active? How do users navigate?
- **Color support** - True color? 256? 16? Monochrome?
- **Consistent design** - Borders, spacing, typography

haukTUI solves all of this with **57+ production-ready components**.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install the CLI
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g @hauktui/cli
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Initialize your project
    
    ```bash
    npx @hauktui/cli init
    ```
    
    This creates a `hauk.config.json` and sets up the component directory.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Add components
    
    ```bash
    npx @hauktui/cli add button dialog toast
    ```
    
    Components are copied to `src/tui/components/` by default.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Use in your app
    
    ```tsx
    import { Button } from './tui/components/button';
    import { Dialog } from './tui/components/dialog';
    
    function App() {
      return (
        <FocusGroup>
          <Button onPress={() => console.log('clicked!')}>
            Press Me
          </Button>
        </FocusGroup>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Component Categories

| Category       | Count | Description                                                          |
| -------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primitive**  | 6     | Basic building blocks: Button, Badge, Avatar, Kbd, Label, Typography |
| **Input**      | 17    | Form controls: TextInput, Select, Checkbox, DatePicker, Form, etc.   |
| **Layout**     | 9     | Structure: Card, Table, Accordion, Resizable, DataTable, etc.        |
| **Navigation** | 8     | Movement: Tabs, Breadcrumb, Sidebar, Menubar, Pagination             |

## Architecture

haukTUI is built on three core packages:

```
@hauktui/tokens       → Design tokens & terminal detection
@hauktui/core         → Focus management & keyboard handling
@hauktui/primitives-ink → React/Ink context providers
```

Components use these packages but they're installed as dependencies when you init.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 18+
- **React** 18+
- **Ink** 4+ (terminal React renderer)

## Philosophy

1. **Copy, don't install** - Full ownership of component code
2. **Keyboard first** - Every component is fully keyboard accessible
3. **Terminal native** - Built for terminals, not adapted from web
4. **Minimal dependencies** - Only what's necessary
5. **TypeScript native** - Types are first-class citizens
